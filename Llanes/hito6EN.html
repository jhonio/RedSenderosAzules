    <p>You will see indigenous vegetation which is predominantly made up of Ash <em>(Fraxinus excelsior)</em> and the common Alder <em>(Alnus glutinosa)</em>. You can also see a type of Maple, <em>(Acer pseudoplatanu)</em> and plants such as the Horsetail <em>(Equisetum telmateia)</em> and Cattails <em>(Typha latifolia)</em>. Other species to be found in this zone are Blackberry <em>(Rubus ulmifolius)</em> and climbing plants like Common Ivy <em>(Hedera helix)</em>. At the margins, the predominant colonising species are bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) that cling to the rocks or thrive on the constantly moist banks. Ferns abound, like <em>Pteridium aquilinum, Polystichum setiferum</em> or the <em>Dryopteris corley</em>, which is endemic in the east of Asturias and Cantabria. Also herbaceous plants like the nettle <em>(Urtica dioica)</em> and mint <em>(Mentha longifolia)</em> are to be found. Amongst the fauna of the area are trout <em>(Salmo trutta)</em>, minnows <em>(Phoxinus phoxinus)</em>, the European Midwife Toad <em>(Alytes obstetricans)</em>, the common frog <em>(Bufo bufo)</em>, as well as the common salamander <em>(Salamandra salamandra)</em>. Other reptiles, like the grass snake <em>(Natrix natrix)</em> are also present. The river serves as a drinking trough for wild boar <em>(Sus scrofa)</em> foxes <em>(Vulpes vulpes)</em> and Roe Deer <em>(Capreolus capreolus)</em>. One important point is directly related to the otter: The otter is a carnivore and belongs to the Mustelid family. It is the only one in our country that has an aquatic habitat. Its physical form shows adaptations that allow movement in water with agility and ease. They need the banks with good vegetation cover for refuge and also to make their burrows. They reproduce at any time of year, with a gestation time of about 60 days. The normal brood is 1-4 young and the youngsters stay with their parents until they are a year old. They feed on all types of aquatic animals like crabs, shellfish and any species of fish. They are not at all hard to see hunting in the waters around Llanes. In earlier times they were subjected to persecution, especially by poachers. The species suffered from the pollution of the water and the ingestion of fish which had been contaminated with chemicals such as PCBs and DDTs. The over exploitation of fish stocks almost caused the otter to disappear from the rivers of Asturias. In 1992 the Otter was listed as an endangered species in the Regional Catalogue of Endangered Mammals of the Principality of Asturias.</p>
