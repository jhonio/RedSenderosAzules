    <p>At the end of the nineteenth century Llanes was a very busy commercial port and was also used for local journeys, due to the difficulty of travelling by land. It was, however, one of the most dangerous ports in north of Spain, due to its location. The first project to construct a breakwater began in 1896. It was to be place on the wharf named Muelle de la Osa. In 1900 a completely straight breakwater was planned. However the autumn weather of that year soon put paid to everything that had been built. It wasn’t until the 1930s that a definitive solution was adopted. It was based upon three enormous monoliths of reinforced concrete, 21m x 21m. These were constructed in El Musel in Gijon. They were transported by sea to Llanes. When they arrived they were hollow cubes. Once put in place they were filled, firstly with gravel and then covered over with cement. These blocks protected the harbour from the fierce winter storms. Nowadays they form the basis of the ambitious artwork, The Cubes of Memory, created by the Basque artist, Augustín Ibarrola.</p>
