         <h4><p>We have come to the ponds. This type of Mediterranean coast aquatic habitat is usually dry in summer, full of water all winter and through being filled or emptied through in spring and autumn. It's the natural cycle for more than a million years. Changing it because it seems that fish die would be equivalent to avoid natural purification summer due to evaporation. The concentration of salts during the evaporation removes invasive vegetation, drying oxygenates the base of the pond sediment. The native fish takes resistance strategies during this dry period.</p></h4>

    <p>The saline depressions lead to the salt marshes. The most characteristic plant is a shrub that can occupy large areas and changes color depending on the time of year and weather conditions. This is the “salicornia” or “cirialera” (<em>Arthrocnemum fruticosum</em>) which is named after the stems surrounded by scales that resemble candelabrum or candles. Invading the field of “salicornia” there is reedbed (<em>Phragmites australis</em>). This plant is not typical of salt marshes and indicates an imbalance in the hydrological functioning of space: there may be more fresh water that comes in a salty wetland and this fact favours expansion. It may also indicate that the space is not dry enough during the summer, giving him time to grow. In any case, it's kind to eradicate in a brackish marsh.<br>
    Birds are found in the ponds. Those who are of a similar size to a dove, with beak and feet quite long, which feed in the water and mud are probably family of waders.<br>
    We highlight the grallae (<em>Himantopus</em>) white belly, black wings, and long thin red legs and black thin and long beak. Swimming in water usually finds different types of waterfowl, with a size between a pigeon and a hen, black or dark brown, there are two species: one larger, which has a white stripes on the tail and wings, red beak with a yellow spot at the tip and a kind of red mask too, is a moorhen (<em>Gallinula moorhen</em>). The other, slightly smaller, has the beak and white mask. This is the coot (<em>Fulica atra</em>). You can see many species of anades but the most abundant are the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). The most colorful colored ducks are males. In the case of mallards, the head of the male is green. Among females is more difficult to distinguish the species as they all have brown plumage to be able to camouflage unsightly with offspring, among the vegetation. The bright colors of the males are to attract females during the reproductive season.</p>
