    <p>This first village belonged to the parish of Clarà and it was until the mid-nineteenth century. This is why at the old documents appear the names of “Botigues de Clarà”, “Casetes de Clarà” and later “Botigues de Mar”. The origin of these names (botigues) refers to the stores where they kept fishing tools and implements. Later, the name of “Baix a mar” appears to distinguish seaside front from the district inland of Torredembarra. The stores gave way to the first houses by the sea. The village was set up with a couple of streets parallel to the coastline and then throughout the entire nineteenth century was developed and began to form the urban structure has remained almost intact until today. The growth of the neighbourhood was bordered by a perimeter formed by the “Muntanyans”, the railway and the SACE old company’s area.<br>
    In the seafront quarter of “Baix a mar” there are still old houses of fishermen: “Cal Brinca”, “Cal Coco”, “Cal Man”, alluding to the name of their former owners, most of whom were fishermen.<br>
    From the point where we are on the right corner, we see the old fish market, popularly known as "El Pes", which is currently a library. Several details of the interior and exterior remain its first feature. In front of that building there is a fishermen's house shared by two families: “Cal Coco” and “Cal Joan de la Mercè”.<br>
    The trail continues towards the “Valls Ivern” square, also called Church Square.</p>
