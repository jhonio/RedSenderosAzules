    <p>The official history of the town of Llanes goes back to the thirteenth century. On a flat stretch of coastal land, close by the territory of Aguilar there emerged over time a square shaped settlement, the perfect form for any town. The town took shape and grew, creating an area for commercial and social activities, which was well known within the jurisdiction. Such was the origin of the Pueblo de Aguilar (The town of Aguilar), the first Llanes. Llanes, town of Aguilar, obtained its rights to independence in the first half of the thirteenth century in the reign of Alfonso IX. Its major constructions date from this era; the defensive walls, the great defensive Tower, rendering it responsible for the defending and monitoring the coast up to San Vicente de La Barquera, together with the Basilica of Santa Maria, completed in 1480. The Tower subsequently became a prison and is the modern day Tourist Information Centre. It was an important port in terms of fishing activity, for both deep sea and inshore fishing, between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries due to the salt trade and its banks and shoals of fish, such as whale, sardines, conger eel, mackerel and red bream, amongst other species. At the end of the nineteenth century it was an important and active port in terms of commerce and local transport, due to the difficulties of land based transport in the area. Nowadays, it is an important tourist centre with a huge variety on offer in this sector. There are more than 1.056 beds in various types of hotels, 11 from the four to one star hotels, 6 pensions and 5 blocks of holiday apartments, and campsites with another 538 places. There are also 45 bars, 6 cafés and 40 restaurants able to serve 2,584 people at any one time!.</p>
