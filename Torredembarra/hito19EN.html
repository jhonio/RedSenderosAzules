    <p>From a historical and traditional view, beach of "Els Muntanyans” has always been considered a different beach by all the inhabitants of Torredembarra. This point of view is mainly thanks  to coastal dune ecosystem, consisting of semi-mobil dunes and lakes of salt water with intermittent flooding and variable salinity, depending on the time of year. This is the fourth wetland in Catalonia  after the marshes of the “Empordà”, “Delta de l’Ebre” and “Delta del Llobregat”. Its importance lies in the fact that it is a stop and rest between the Llobregat Delta and the Ebro Delta for birds that follow the migratory routes parallel to the coast.<br>
    This space, considered as a wetland, including the bath area of the beach, is a Natural Interest Area (PEIN) by appointment of Catalonian’s Government and is part of Site of Community Importance (SCI) defined by the European Directive 92/43/EEC. This SCI is called “Coasts of Tarragona” and the code is ES5140007. The SCI has been created to protected wildlife and habitats and because its natural and ecological value.<br>
    In relation to flora and fauna, is a wetland with many endemic species, both animal and vegetable.

    As animal species found: heron (<em>Egretta garzetta</em>), coots (<em>Fulica atra</em>), the mallard (<em>Anas platyrhincos</em>), Grebe (<em>Tachybaptus ruficollis</em>), Black-winged Stilt (<em>Himantopus himantopus</em>), Kentish Plover (<em>Charadrius alexandrinus</em>), lion ant (<em>Myrmeleon fromicarius</em>) and killifish (<em>Lebias iberian</em>).<br>
    As main plants found: marram grass (<em>Ammophila arenaria</em>), sea lilies (<em>Pancratium maritimum</em>), the plantain (<em>Plantago sp.</em>), Samphire (<em>Crithmum maritimum</em>), tamarisk (<em>Amarix gallica</em>), cattails (<em>Typha latifolia</em>) and various species of rushes and reeds (<em>Phragmites australis</em>).<br>
