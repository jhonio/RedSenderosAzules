    <p>We are now in the access point at the residential area of “Nova Torredembarra”. On the high bath season, we find the corresponding lifeguard module on the beach of “Els Muntanyans” equipped with first aid equipment and a defibrillator. This beach is not an urban beach, so facilities began later than urban beaches in the town, and end before the others. In addition to the module, the lifeguard service is reinforced with three towers where beach is more crowded.<br>
    The lifeguard module has a direct and constant communication by radio and telephone with local police which also has a direct line to ambulance services and doctors at Primary Care Centre in town.<br>
    Along the trail path we can access to the sand beach by six points, where there are installed wooden boardwalks on the sand, facilities are installed also beside these points. In total six showers are installed (one on each access point), a footbath at the nearest access to the “Club Marítim de Torredembarra”, and three selective collection of waste, at   which it can be selectively deposited fractions of paper, cans, glass and organic. Throughout the beach are conveniently placed double bins, one for the general fraction and the other for packaging, because it is the most abundant fraction of selective waste on beaches.<br>
    These wooden boardwalk are located at the entrances near to campingsites “Relax-Sol” and “Clarà” and residential areas of “Nova Torredembarra”, “Clarà Mar”, “Maritima Residencial Sud”. There is also a concrete walkway near “Club Marítim Torredembarra” which allow access to the beach for disabled people with wheelchair.<br>
    Near the trail we found two sanitary cubicles, the first one located next to “Club Marítim Torredembarra” (adapted for people with reduced mobility), and the other one located at the access point near “Nova Torredembarra”. There is not allowed to have some facilities at inside the Natural Area.<br>At the trail and near the access points there are information signs explaining the values of Natural Area of “Els Muntanyans” and also visiting rules of the area. There are also posters with all the information and criteria of Blue Flag and related facilities.</p>
